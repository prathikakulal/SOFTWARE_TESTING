📘 Skill Lab – Day 4 Report
🚀 Deployment & Git Fundamentals
Day-4 of the Skill Lab was an extremely insightful session where I got hands-on experience with web deployment and version control using Git—two of the most essential tools in modern software development.

🌐 Web Deployment using Render
One of the key activities was learning how to deploy a portfolio website using Render, a cloud-based hosting platform. With guidance from the tutor, I followed the complete deployment process:

Preparing the project files for hosting

Creating a web service on Render

Uploading and connecting my project to the platform

Going live with a public URL

This activity helped me understand how to take a locally developed project and make it accessible on the internet—an essential skill for showcasing my work.

🧰 Introduction to Git & Version Control
The second part of the session focused on Git, a powerful version control system widely used in the software industry. I learned how to:

Clone a repository from GitHub to my local machine

Fork a repository to make independent changes

Push code to a remote repository

Track and manage changes using version control commands

These are critical steps in collaborative development, open-source contributions, and personal project maintenance. Practicing them gave me a clearer understanding of managing code efficiently and safely.

💡 Key Takeaways
Learned to deploy a live website using Render

Understood the basics of Git and GitHub workflows

Practiced essential commands like git clone, git push, and git fork

Gained experience in managing code versions and working with remote repositories

🎯 Outcome
By the end of the session, I successfully deployed my portfolio website and became confident in using Git for version control. The session gave me a solid foundation in two essential areas of web development—deployment and collaboration.
