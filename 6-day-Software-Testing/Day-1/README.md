## ðŸ“˜ Day-1: Introduction to Software Testing Tools & Documentation Practices

Day-1 of the Skill Lab introduced students to the fundamentals of **software testing** and the importance of maintaining clear and effective **documentation** throughout the software development lifecycle. The session began with discussions on why testing is a critical part of software quality assurance and how it helps identify issues early, ensuring better product reliability and performance.

A key focus was placed on the **usage of modern testing tools** in real-world scenarios. Students were introduced to various platforms and tools used in the industry, with **Zoho Test Automation tools** being one of the primary examples explored through hands-on tutorials. These tutorials guided students on how to navigate the tool interface, create test cases, and manage test data, providing practical experience in structured testing processes.

Additionally, the session emphasized the role of **documentation in software testing**â€”from writing test plans and test cases to tracking defects and test results. Students learned how proper documentation not only improves team collaboration but also serves as a reference point for debugging and future enhancements.

By the end of the session, students had a clearer understanding of testing workflows, the significance of organized documentation, and were equipped with beginner-level experience in using industry-relevant testing tools.
