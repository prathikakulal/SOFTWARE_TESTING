📘 Skill Lab – Day 2 Report
🔧 Building and Deploying a Portfolio Website using Python
On Day-2 of the Skill Lab, I had the opportunity to design, build, and deploy a personal portfolio website using Python. The session was focused on introducing us to real-world web development practices and giving us a platform to showcase our skills and achievements in a professional manner.

🖥️ What I Learned and Implemented
During the session, I followed a step-by-step process to create a portfolio website from scratch. I used Python-based tools and frameworks to build different sections of the portfolio such as:

An "About Me" section

Projects and technical skills

Education and certifications

Contact and social media links

This helped me understand the structure of a basic web application and how to present my profile in a clean and organized way.

🌿 Introduction to Virtual Environments
A major concept introduced in this session was the use of virtual environments (venv) in Python. I learned how to:

Create a separate environment for each project

Install packages locally without affecting global Python settings

Maintain clean and conflict-free dependencies

This practice is essential for scalable and professional software development, and I now understand its importance and how to implement it.

🌍 Deployment Experience
One of the most exciting parts of the day was deploying the portfolio online. After completing the design and development locally, I learned how to:

Prepare the project for deployment

Choose a suitable hosting platform

Make my website accessible through a live URL

This was my first time taking a project from local development to a live web application, and it gave me confidence in managing deployments.

📝 Key Takeaways
I created and deployed a personal portfolio website using Python

I understood how to use and manage virtual environments effectively

I gained hands-on experience in web hosting and deployment

I learned the importance of having an online presence as a developer

✅ Outcome
By the end of the session, I had a fully functional, publicly accessible portfolio website, which I can continue to update and enhance as I grow my skill set. This session helped me take a solid step toward building my personal brand and showcasing my work online.
