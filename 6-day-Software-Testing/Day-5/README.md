<!-- 📘 Skill Lab – Day 5 Report
🔍 API Testing, CSS Selectors & Web Automation
Day-5 of the Skill Lab introduced me to API testing, web automation, and the importance of precise CSS object selection. The session was packed with hands-on activities that gave me a deeper understanding of how modern web applications function and how developers ensure quality through automation and testing tools.

🌐 Understanding REST APIs & Testing
We began the session by learning about the REST architecture and how APIs enable communication between the frontend and backend of a web application. I got the opportunity to:

Make real-time API calls from a local development environment

Test deployed APIs using tools like Postman

Work with authentication headers and query/request parameters

Debug and validate API responses effectively

This experience gave me a clear understanding of how data flows between client and server, and how developers test and troubleshoot APIs during development.

🎯 CSS Selectors & DOM Manipulation
Next, we focused on CSS selectors, which are crucial for both styling and accessing elements in the DOM. I practiced selecting elements using different CSS selector techniques and understood how they are used for:

Targeting specific elements on a webpage

Applying styles efficiently

Scripting interactions and automation using tools like Selenium

🤖 Web Automation with Selenium
In the final part of the session, we explored Selenium, a popular tool for web automation and testing. I learned how to:

Write basic Selenium scripts

Use CSS selectors to target elements for interaction

Automate browser actions like clicking, typing, and navigating

Simulate user behavior to test UI components

These skills are incredibly valuable in automating repetitive testing tasks and building more robust applications.

💡 Key Takeaways
Gained hands-on experience in API testing and debugging

Learned how to use authentication headers and request parameters

Practiced CSS selectors for targeting DOM elements

Explored web automation with basic Selenium scripts

Understood the role of automation in modern QA and development workflows

🎯 Outcome
By the end of Day-5, I was able to confidently test APIs, debug request/response cycles, and automate browser interactions using Selenium. These are essential skills for both full-stack developers and quality assurance engineers, and this session helped me build a strong foundation in both areas.
